## Real Developer Needs, Not Hype

> The average developer spends only **52 minutes per day actually coding** (nearly 4.5 hours/week) in the editor. When agentic/AI features—like code refactoring, chat, or “fix this”—are used, those requests add up quickly.

Many platforms limit users to just **25–50** agentic prompts a month on free plans—a fraction of what is required for productive development.

Lyra’s “bring your own key” or what I like to call BYOAK (Bring your own API Key) approach enables most users to easily handle over 100+ prompts per DAY (with longer contexts, e.g. 700 lines of code selected), all on generous free AI quotas. Yes, that's per DAY. No more “usage anxiety” or “hit the wall” moments.

## Why Lyra?

Agentic code browsers and AI-powered IDEs are revolutionizing programming—but frequent tradeoffs remain:

- **High prices \& tight quotas:**
    - Tools like **Cursor**, **Windsurf**, **Augment**, and others often charge \$15+ to \$30/month for Pro features, while their free plans are heavily limited. Even GitHub Copilot only offers 50 chat requests/month! To put into perspective that's less than 2 requests per day!
      
Most platforms quickly direct users to a paid plan—sometimes after only a few dozen to a couple hundred prompts. Now for students like myself, ChatGPT plans are a good alternative but switching between IDE and browser gets frustrating and copy pasting just isn't ideal.

Lyra aims to solve all of these issues!
