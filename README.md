## Real Developer Needs, Not Hype

> The average developer spends only **52 minutes per day actually coding** (nearly 4.5 hours/week) in the editor. When agentic/AI features—like code refactoring, chat, or “fix this”—are used, those requests add up quickly.

Many platforms limit users to just **25–50** agentic prompts a month on free plans—a fraction of what is required for productive development.

**Lyra’s “bring your own key” approach enables most users to easily handle over 100+ prompts per DAY (with longer contexts, e.g. 700 lines of code selected), all on generous free AI quotas. Yes, that's per DAY.** No more “usage anxiety” or “hit the wall” moments.

## Why Lyra?

Agentic code browsers and AI-powered IDEs are revolutionizing programming—but frequent tradeoffs remain:

- **High prices \& tight quotas:**
    - Tools like **Cursor**, **Windsurf**, **Augment**, and others often charge \$15+ to \$30/month for Pro features, while their free plans are heavily limited:
        - **Cursor:** Free tier allows just 2,000 completions and 50 premium agent requests per month.
        - **Windsurf:** Free plan provides 25 prompt credits per month, with Pro plans starting at \$15/month.
        - **GitHub Copilot (free tier):** Offers 2,000 code completions and 50 chat requests/month in VS Code before reaching the paywall.
        - **Augment:** 50 free agent actions per month, then \$30/month for Developer tier.
- **Limited “free” usage:**
Most platforms quickly direct users to a paid plan—sometimes after only a few dozen to a couple hundred prompts.
- **Privacy concerns:**
A majority of solutions are proprietary and closed-source, with user code or usage data potentially collected to improve AI models.
- **Opaque data policies:**
It is often unclear when project code may be sent to a third party for model training or analytics.

## The Lyra Difference

**Open-source and built for the wider developer community:**

- **Free, forever and open-source:**
Core features are available without credit card or subscription requirements.
- **No limits on AI usage:**
Bring Your Own API key for Cloudflare Workers AI—use personal free allotments, upgrade if desired, and maintain full transparency and control.
- **No vendor lock-in:**
Project code always resides in personal GitHub repositories; Lyra never stores or processes project code on external servers.
- **Real privacy:**
AI keys and code remain on the client side, never reaching the backend.
- **Modern IDE features:**
    - Monaco Editor, xterm.js terminal, live web preview, GitHub syncing, and more.

## Crystal-Clear Data Use

- **Open development:**
Everything—including security controls—is developed in public view.
- **User’s code, user’s rules:**
No black box AI training on private code.
- **Agentic AI, without the data grab:**
Prompts and API keys are never seen by Lyra’s infrastructure.
