# Lyra

**Privacy-first, open-source cloud IDE for code, AI, and the modern developer.**

> *In Development –– August, 2025*


## Real Developer Needs, Not Hype

> The average developer spends only **52 minutes per day actually coding** (nearly 4.5 hours/week) in their editor. If you use agentic/AI features—like code refactoring, chat, or “fix this”—those requests add up quickly.

Other platforms limit you to just **25–50** agentic prompts a month on free plans—a fraction of what a real developer needs to work productively.

**Lyra’s “bring your own key” approach means most users can easily handle over 100+ prompts per DAY (with longer context, e.g. 700 lines of code selected), all on generous free AI quotas. Yes, you read that right. Per DAY.** No more “usage anxiety” or “hit the wall” moments.


## Why Lyra?

Agentic code browsers and AI-powered IDEs are revolutionizing programming—but they often come with tradeoffs:

- **High prices \& tight quotas:**
    - Tools like **Cursor**, **Windsurf**, **Augment**, and others often charge \$15+ to \$30/month for Pro features, and their free plans are heavily limited:
        - **Cursor:** Free tier gives you just 2,000 completions and 50 premium agent requests per month (after which you have to pay).
        - **Windsurf:** Free plan offers 25 prompt credits per month, with Pro plans starting at \$15/month.
        - **GitHub Copilot (free tier):** Recently improved to 2,000 code completions and 50 chat requests/month in VS Code. Once you exceed this, it’s paywalled.
        - **Augment:** 50 free agent actions per month; then \$30/month for Developer tier.
- **Limited “free” usage:**
Most platforms quickly push you to a paid plan—often after just a few dozen to a couple hundred prompts!
- **Privacy concerns:**
Many solutions are proprietary and closed-source, and your code/usage data may be collected to improve their AI models.
- **Opaque data policies:**
It’s hard to know when your project code will be sent to a third party for model training or analytics.
